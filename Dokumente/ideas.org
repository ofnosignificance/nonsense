#+description: List of ideas to make, eventually

* Forge of Empires clone:
- city building game like Forge of Empires, made for people who have
  nostalgia for old (2015-2019) FoE and who want to have control over
  the game, their data, want the game progress to be saved locally
- completely offline, without DRM, without online requirement, no
  addictive elements, no incentive to login at a particular time,
  completely public domain/non-copyrighted software and assets, no 
  restrictions on what you can do with the game, self-hostable
- multiple ages to go through, with a research tree that requires weeks
  to go through one age
- fighting system with isometric map, different units that each have an
  optimal enemy for each for defensive and offense, different o/d values
  for other enemies, each unit type is the same in each "age"
- written in C++17 or newer and Raylib/OpenGL, very portable, has to run on
  Windows, Linux, OpenBSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD, minimal depedencies
- local Sqlite database for game data, can be opened and read by humans,
  can be modified by the user easily
- hacking, modding, and additional texture encouraged, no artificial
  limitations
- no multiplayer, this would be too difficult, and would suck, since you
  would need to rely on the server for months and years (ideally), so
  that is bad
- be playable with custom frontends (server + frontend structure),
  possible to change values with the command line, graphical main game
- more detail and historic accuracy
- goods are depedent on the map you get and you have only two viable
  goods for each game session, improved good production for these, poor
  production for all others
- Currencies: Coins (Production, streets, etc.), Supplies (military,
  houses), Metals (expansions), diamonds are part of the game, but
  obviously just possible get through playing, no p2w
- Always the option to solve problems and getting map regions with
  either goods/trading or battles
- autobattles, which purposefully are worse than manual battles, the bot
  has the upper hand when in autobattle and there is no insane
  descrepancy between the fighting units
- No events, no special buildings, only buildings from the ages and
  great buildings
- Great buildings require "forge" points to level up, blueprints
  required to build them
- fair negations for side quests
- side quests to get blueprints for great buildings, get game points

* Common Lisp IRC client
- IRC client, no compatibility with IRCv3, IRCv3 suxx
- written in Common Lisp
- log history compatible with irssi
- very simple, no sidebar, for neither nicks nor channels
- switching between channels like with irssi
- doesn't require more depedencies than the networking library,
  potentially only /dev/tcp/host/port, so bash, and no other
  requirements, purely TUI or CLI application, like irssi

* OS project
- make something for the Kotori command, nini command
- make some weird black voodoo magic POSIX compatability layer that
  makes running POSIX stuff possible, but doesn't make the OS require to
  be UNIX-clone (probably impossible, particularly impossible for me,
  but I like the idea of it)
- write a shell language that can be used for most standard unix
  utilities
- have the standard utilities be one executable that acts according to
  the symlink it has been called by, think busybox/toybox
- not be a retard and fix my IDT before I fantasize about things that
  will never exist. 

* eternal-monologue.net self-hosted
- Self-host it from a RPI/Starfive Visionfive 2/other SBC
- use NetBSD as the OS, use wireguard-go instead of the native NetBSD
  wireguard implementation (for the reverse proxying)
- Minimalist web server that only serves static HTML pages over HTTP
  (without HTTPS, since the reverse proxy already is encrypted),
  research viable software for that, use nginx when anything else fails
- Host birdsnest.moe and eternal-monologue.net both from home, use the
  VPS only for reverse proxying
- ...

* Gameboy emulator
- graphical debugger, no print-debugging, use that to work with the
  emulator, and do this first and foremost
